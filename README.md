# Black-Myth-Wukong-Build-Simulator v0.1

This is just a simple test, nothing serious. I plan on working on this as a side hobby over the course of a few weeks.

Version 0.1 (21/10/2024):
added weapon selection and attributes

Version 0.15 (21/10/2024):
added CSS file linked in the HTML and created a GitHub/workflows folder containing static.yml to enable website hosting.

Version 0.2 (21/10/2024):
added headgear selection and attributes. Weapon and headgear stats display when not selected, ensuring clarity. Enhanced character stats are updated based on selected gear, improving overall functionality.
