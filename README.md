# Black-Myth-Wukong-Build-Simulator v0.3

This is just a simple test, nothing serious. I plan on working on this as a side hobby til December.

Version 0.1 (20/10/2024):
Added weapon selection and attributes

Version 0.15 (21/10/2024):
Added CSS file linked in the HTML and created a GitHub/workflows folder containing static.yml to enable website hosting.

Version 0.2 (21/10/2024):
added headgear selection and attributes. Weapon and headgear stats display when not selected, ensuring clarity. Enhanced character stats are updated based on selected gear, improving overall functionality.

Version 0.25 (21/10/2024):
Made additional updates for improved appearance and organisation. Changed the descriptions to be more understandable and added resistance attributes for weapons as the game actually doesn't say.

Version 0.3 (23/10/2024): 
Added chest armor selection
